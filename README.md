========

### What is this?
Gesture-based midi controller library using Leap Motion.
This is designed to be embedded in a program that interfaces with your operating system's MIDI architecture. It is not a standalone application. For an example of using it with OSX CoreMIDI, see the LeapMIDIX repo: https://github.com/revmischa/leapmidix

### Unstable
This is a work in progress. If you have issues feel free to contact me about getting things running.

### Purpose
The idea of this project is to let people add their own gestures motions that can be interpreted, and sets of these defined as "programs" a user should be able to select from. If you'd like to add your own, please send me a pull request.
